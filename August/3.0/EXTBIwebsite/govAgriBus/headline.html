  <h1>Agricultural Government Data as <br> Semantic Web Data</h1>
  <p>In this project we develop a solution which allows business intelligence tools to integrated external data from a shared repository ad-hoc. On this endpoint we publish the Danish agricultural data collection integrated with the central company registry (CVR) and make it available to the public. This integration makes it possible to query across this data. </p>
