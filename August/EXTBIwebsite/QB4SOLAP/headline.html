  <h1>Modeling and Querying Spatial <br> Data Warehouses on the Semantic Web </h1>
  <p> This research emphasizes on how to utilize spatial data warehousing on the Semantic Web by extending a multi-dimensional data cube model with spatial members. We present a spatially enhanced vocabulary as QB4SOLAP, published MD data as RDF with this vocabulary. Finally, as a proof-of-concept we implemented spatial and metric analysis on spatial members along with OLAP operations and re-defined them as spatial OLAP (SOLAP) operators.
