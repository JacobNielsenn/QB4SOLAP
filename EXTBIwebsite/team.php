          <p>My general research area is business intelligence and big data, more specifically technologies for "Big Multidimensional Data" - the integration and analysis of large amounts of complex and highly dynamic multidimensional data in domains such as logistics (indoor/outdoor moving objects), smart grids (energy data management), transport (vehicle GPS data), as well as more general tools for "cloud intelligence" (business intelligence (BI)/analytics in, for, and with the cloud).</p>

          <p>Katja Hose is an associate professor at the department of Computer Science at Aalborg University (AAU). Before joining Aalborg University, she was a post-doctoral researcher at the Max-Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbr&uuml;cken, Germany, and obtained her doctoral degree in Computer Science from Ilmenau University of Technology. Her research interests include Linked Open Data, knowledge representation, query processing and optimization in distributed systems, rank-aware query operators, and energy data management.  </p>

          <p>My research interests in general are geospatial semantic web, linked open data and it's applications with spatio-temporal data and business intelligence (BI). My work investigates assigning semantics to seamlessly generated  big data in different topical domains by using and creating relevant vocabularies. More specifically I use open governmental data sets with spatial and temporal dimensions in domains such as agriculture, environment, land-use and integrate with a big RDF graph in order to derive business intelligence.  </p>

          <p>My research area is Business Intelligence over the Semantic Web, particularly Semantic Web data warehousing and OLAP over RDF data.  Currently, my research is focused on efficient execution of OLAP queries over RDF data and SPARQL query processing and optimization in federated systems. </p>

          <img src="/images/kim.jpg" alt="">
          <p>My work is centered around the Semantic Web. I have worked in areas ranging from RDF data integration and conversion to Business Intelligence Query performance. In my work I have both used real datasets such as danish agricultural/goverment data and syntetical in the form of the TPC-H Benchmark dataset. </p>
